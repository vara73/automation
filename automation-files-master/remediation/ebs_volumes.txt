ebs_volumes remediation:

Copy the role from the output stack and assign that role to the CMK keys.
Add the Users to the group created by the stack for you with the stack name which you can see in the output stack. It will exclude the
users from executing the state machine and the access to lambda fucntions.



In order to encrypt for all the volumes in all the regions, the region parameter shouldn't be there as below.
If delete "yes" then it will delete the unencrypted volumes
If you want to use the CMK it should be given in the below format else don't give the keys as input parameter which will encrypt by default master keys.

{
  "delete": "yes",
  "key": {
    "us-east-1": "5f5af7df-dasasa3f-4878-a491-b3767de1d8d0",
    "ap-northeast-1": "68217d78-c287-42dc-92ec-eacb46041675"
  }
}



If you want to run for the specific regions then the region names should be given in the list as below.
If delete = "no" then it won't delete any unencrypted volumes.

{
  "delete": "no",
  "region": [
    "us-east-1",
    "ap-northeast-1"
  ],
  "key": {
    "us-east-1": "5f5acsadasdf-da3f-4878-a491-b3767de1d8d0",
    "ap-northeast-1": "682szdsadd78-c287-42dc-92ec-eacb46041675"
  }
}


If you don't want to encrypt the selected volumes or instances then it should be given in the list as below..


{
  "delete": "yes",
  "region": [
    "us-east-1",
    "ap-northeast-1"
  ],
  "not_volume" : ["vol-asdf4rsddv","vol-sdexgesderfdd"],
  "not_instance" : ["i-23sxsdwdzxvdc","i-zxzcxzvdsfdvcc"],
  "key": {
    "us-east-1": "5f5asdsa7df-da3f-4878-a491-b3767de1d8d0",
    "ap-northeast-1": "68217dsdsssds-c287-42dc-92ec-eacb46041675"
  }
}


for the volumes to use the default keys it should be in the below format.

{
  "delete": "yes",
  "region": [
    "us-east-1",
    "ap-northeast-1"
  ],
  "not_volume" : ["vol-asdf4rsddv","vol-sdexgesderfdd"],
  "not_instance" : ["i-23sxsdwdzxvdc","i-zxzcxzvdsfdvcc"]
}




NOTE : "Region" input parameter must be given, if not it will encrypt all the volumes in all the regions.
